from the other Domain-Specific Functional Safety Levels (ASIL).

The main purpose of tis policy is to prevent applications and container tools
with interferring with other processes on the system. The QM needs to support
further isolate containers run within the qm from the qm_t process and from
each other.

For now all of the control processes in the qm other then containers will run
with the same qm_t type.
